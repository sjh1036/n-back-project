# Project Title

The N-Back Test is a program developed based on the cognitive test of the same name for the Meta Quest.

## Description

Developed using Unity and C# for play on the Meta Quest, the N-Back Test, as well as the similar Tower of London Test, was developed as a part of our entry to the UNH Undergraduate Research Conference.
The test itself seeks to test the user's short-term memory by flashing sequences of letters that the user must select in accordance with the difficulty selected.
The objective of this project was to create a virtual environment to simulate visual disturbances to the user's balance (tilting view) as well as provide a soothing atmosphere to the user.
The data collected from the user relates their score in the test to their center of balance throughout the test (i.e. how different difficulties affect the sway of the user).

### Executing program

You must have Unity Editor 2022 downloaded to run this program. Load the scene from the "Assets/Scenes" directory, connect a Meta Quest to your computer, and run the Unity Editor to play the game.
